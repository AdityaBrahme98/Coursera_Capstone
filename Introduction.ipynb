    "# 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the annual United States road crash statistics by ASIRT, more than 38,000 people die every year in crashes on U.S. roadways. The U.S. traffic fatality rate is 12.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. It is evident that with the increasing number of vehicles on urban and suburban roads, the cases of vehicle accidents are also increasing. This project aims to analyse vehicle collision data available in public domain provided by Seattle Geo Data (SDOT) and derive some useful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Seattle Traffic Department needs to reduce the number of road traffic accidents that occur on the city roads. Given the available data, it has been agreed that the best approach would be to be able to predict the severity of accidents that may occur due to certain conditions. It is believed that this new information will help with better planning and decision making for all stakeholders thereby reducing the risks and by extension, reducing the possibility of the occurrence of future accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the Traffic Department has established a correlation between several factors such as weather, traffic, etc and the severity of road traffic accidents. The extent of this correlation remains sketchy and this model intends to determine the extent of the these dependencies and predict how they affect the severity of car accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected audience of this report includes but is not restricted to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Seattle Traffic Department\n",
    "2. Seattle Police Department\n",
    "3. Seattle Emergency Services\n",
    "4. The Medical Board/Hospitals\n",
    "5. All road users in Seattle\n",
    "6. Travellers that may drive to/through Seattle enroute other destinations."

    "# 2. Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "Data provided by the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) on vehicle collisions along with its severity might be useful to derive insights and may show some pattern with the environmental factors like weather, road conditions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset name : Seattle SDOT Collisions Data From City of Seattle Open Data\n",
    "Source for dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/jonleon/seattle-sdot-collisions-data \n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute Information: https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Collisions_OD.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 40 columns and 221144 rows having different kinds of data like, collision severity, road conditions, number of people involved, location of collision, weather etc\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 62% of accidents belong to category \"Property Damage Only Collision\" while 26% belong to category \"Injury Collision\" \n",
    "2. 50% of accidents tend to happen between 12:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M.\n",
    "3. Between 00:00 to 04:00, cases of severity 1 (\"Property damage only collision\") incidents are higher than rest of the day percentage wise\n",
    "4. 11% of all cases in late night are due to speeding \n",
    "5. ~18% of collisions happening in morning and early morning are due to inattention of drivers \n",
    "6. Motor Vehicles tend to hit fixed objects more during late night time \n",
    "7. Severe accidents majorly happens at a block or an intersection \n",
    "8. Location \"6th AVE AND JAMES ST\" has abnormally high number of collisions since 2016 \n",
    "9. There is a sudden drop in accident cases in 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemi\n",
    "10. There are over 250 cases of collisions at \"BATTERY ST TUNNEL\"\n",
    "11. There are relatively more cases of alcoholic and drug influenced collision during December (Probably because of holiday season)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of severity\n",
    "There are 5 categories of severity. It is safe to assume that the missing SEVERITYCODE must belong to unknown category i.e. Category 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 0\t-Unknown\n",
    "2. 1\t-Property Damage Only Collision\n",
    "3. 2\t-Injury Collision\n",
    "4. 2b\t-Serious Injury Collision\n",
    "5. 3\t-Fatality Collision\n",
    "6. nan\t-Unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time of accident\n",
    "We have time of accident for ~76% of data. In order to analyse timewise, splitting the data into 6 categories viz. 'Late Night', 'Early Morning', 'Morning', 'Noon', 'Eve', 'Night'\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 00:00 to 04:00   -Late Night\t\n",
    "2. 04:00 to 08:00   -Early Morning\t\n",

    "6. 20:00 to 00:00   -Night\t\n",
    "\n",
    "we can see that about 50% of accidents tend to happen during the day time i.e. between 12:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no clear relation between severity of accidents and time of the day. During Late Night, cases of severity 1 (\"Property damage only collision\") incidents are higher than rest of the day percentage wise.\n",
    "3 of 4 accidents happening during late night are just doing property damage\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNDERINFL\n",
    "For the column UNDERINFL there are 4 unique values. Intuitively, it seems that 'Y' and '1' denotes the same thing which is the person was under influence of alcohol. Same is with 'N' and '0'. Hence, let's save the column values in systematic format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SEVERITYCODE\n",
    "We can see that 62% of accidents belong to Category 1 which is \"Property Damage Only Collision\"\n",
    "26% belong to Category 2, \"Injury Collision\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speeding\n",
    "\n",
    "11% of all cases in late night are due to speeding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alcoholic\n",
    "\n",
    "Of total alcoholic and drug cases, ~64% cases happen during Night and Late Night\n",
    "We can see there are relatively more cases of alcoholic and drug influenced collision during December (Probably because of holiday season)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "People are morelikely to hit Parked car during Night. We can also see there are alot of \"Other\" collision type of cases in late night.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is ~65% more chance to encounter a collision while taking a Left turn than taking a Right turn\n",
    "\n",
    "Location \"6th AVE AND JAMES ST\" has abnormally high number of collisions since 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, whole world faced a pandemic of the COVID-19 outbreak. Its effect on travel behavior have also been sudden and wide ranging. We can see that there is a sudden drop in accident cases in 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic\n"
